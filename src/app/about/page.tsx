            I'm a senior at Cornell University, studying Information Science,
            Systems, and Technology with a focus on interactive technologies and
            UX design. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to create
            intuitive and impactful solutions. At Cornell, I've collaborated on
            a variety of projects that have reinforced my belief in the power of
            software to address real-world challenges.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me outside enjoying nature â€“
            hiking, camping, fishing, or stargazing! I'm also a big fan of
            basketball, tennis, and fitness.
